# Vikunja API Integration for OpenWebUI

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a tool for OpenWebUI that integrates with the Vikunja to-do app API. The tool will enable a language model to interact with Vikunja, allowing for multi-step operations such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting to-dos.

## Objectives
1. Create a VikunjaTodoLoader class for API interactions
2. Implement methods for key Vikunja API operations
3. Design a clear data structure for API responses
4. Develop a system prompt for effective LLM-tool interaction
5. Integrate the tool with OpenWebUI

## Key Features
- Fetch open to-dos
- Create new to-dos
- Update existing to-dos
- Delete to-dos
- Multi-step interactions between LLM and Vikunja API

## Technical Considerations
- Use async HTTP requests with aiohttp
- Structure data for easy parsing by the LLM
- Implement error handling and logging
- Ensure compatibility with smaller language models (e.g., 12B parameter models)

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up the basic VikunjaTodoLoader class structure
2. Implement individual API operation methods
3. Design and implement the data formatting for API responses
4. Create a system prompt for LLM instruction
5. Integrate the tool with OpenWebUI
6. Test the integration with various LLM models
7. Refine and optimize based on testing results

## Challenges and Solutions
- Multi-step interactions: Break down complex tasks into simple, discrete steps
- LLM context management: Provide clear, structured outputs at each step
- Smaller model limitations: Use careful prompt engineering and simplified outputs

## Success Criteria
- Successful integration with OpenWebUI
- Ability to perform all basic Vikunja operations via LLM interactions
- Clear and parseable responses from the Vikunja API tool
- Effective handling of multi-step interactions by the LLM

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced Vikunja features (e.g., task prioritization, tagging)
- Optimize for different LLM sizes and capabilities
- Develop user documentation for the Vikunja integration tool

This project builds upon the successful implementation of the Paperless document integration by [github/jleine](https://github.com/JLeine/open-webui) , adapting the approach for a to-do application context. The focus is on creating a tool that allows for flexible, multi-step interactions while remaining compatible with the constraints of smaller language models and the OpenWebUI framework.

# Vikunja Todo Tool for OpenWebUI: Project Status

**Version:** 1.5
**Date:** 2024-08-26
**Last Updated:** 2024-08-26 18:30 UTC

## Revision History
- v1.5 (2024-08-26): Updated status after implementing get_projects() method and refining tool structure.
- v1.4 (2024-08-26): Refactored code to align with OpenWebUI expectations, introducing HelpFunctions class.
- v1.3 (2024-08-26): Updated status after implementing Valves system and URL sanitization.
- v1.0 (2024-08-26): Initial comprehensive status report after achieving basic todo retrieval functionality.

## Recent Achievements
1. Successfully implemented a get_projects() method to retrieve and display all Vikunja projects.
2. Refactored the tool structure to better align with OpenWebUI expectations, including the introduction of a HelpFunctions class.
3. Improved error handling and logging throughout the tool.
4. Enhanced the tool's ability to handle both general and project-specific todo queries.
5. Updated the system prompt to accurately reflect the tool's capabilities.

## Current Status
- The tool can now fetch todos from a configurable Vikunja instance, either all todos or project-specific todos.
- A new get_projects() method allows retrieval of all project names.
- The tool structure now includes a HelpFunctions class for better organization and reusability.
- Error handling and logging have been improved for better debugging and user feedback.

## Next Steps
1. Implement functionality to add task counts to the project list.
2. Add ability to create new projects.
3. Implement features to rename or delete projects.
4. Add functionality to show completed tasks or tasks due within a certain timeframe.
5. Continue refining the tool structure and error handling based on OpenWebUI requirements.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Aligning tool structure with OpenWebUI expectations
  Solution: Refactored code to include a HelpFunctions class and ensure proper method structure.
- Challenge: Handling multiple query types (all todos vs. project-specific)
  Solution: Implemented query parsing in the get_todos method to differentiate between query types.

## Key Learnings
1. OpenWebUI tools can have multiple methods for LLM interaction, not just a single method as initially thought.
2. Proper indentation and structure are crucial for the tool to function correctly in OpenWebUI.
3. Reusing existing functionality (like project querying) can efficiently expand tool capabilities.
4. Clear and comprehensive system prompts are essential for guiding the LLM in using the tool correctly.

## Future Considerations
1. Explore more advanced Vikunja API features for potential integration.
2. Consider implementing a caching mechanism to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
3. Investigate the possibility of adding user authentication to the tool for multi-user environments.
4. Continue monitoring OpenWebUI development for new features or best practices that could enhance the tool.

This status update reflects the recent improvements in the Vikunja Todo Tool, particularly the addition of the get_projects() method and the structural refinements to better align with OpenWebUI expectations. The project continues to progress towards a more comprehensive and robust todo management solution for OpenWebUI.
